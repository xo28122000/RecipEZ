# RecipEZ - Right Out of the Fridge
This was my AngelHacks 2019 Silicon Valley project. 
RecipEZA crossplatform app built on react native to give recommendations according to the ingredients you have. 
We integrated the AWS rekognize to recognize the items in your fridge only by waking through the fridge with camera on your phone.
